This project marks the first time i felt super proud of something i made completely and entirely on my own.

It features: 
* A button which when pressed will generate 2 passwords
* A slider to change password length from 1 to 20 characters
* Options to disable character types (numbers and special characters)
* A light mode switch
* User feedback on the inputs
